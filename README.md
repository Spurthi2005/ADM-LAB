🌍 Analyzing Global Air Quality Trends Using Data Visualization in Python
📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is a pressing global concern with direct impacts on public health, climate, and ecosystems. This project aims to analyze global air quality trends using real-world datasets and powerful visualization tools in Python. By studying key pollutants and their variations across regions and time, we seek to uncover hidden patterns and generate insights to support better policy and awareness.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze global air quality metrics (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3) across different countries and time periods.
Visualize seasonal variations and long-term trends in air pollution levels.
Compare air quality between cities and regions with varying environmental regulations.
Investigate correlations between pollution, population density, industrial activity, and public health indices.
🗂️ Datasets
We will use datasets from the following trusted sources:

Kaggle
OpenAQ
World Health Organization (WHO)
The datasets include pollutant concentrations measured over time across multiple global locations.

🧰 Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries will be used for data analysis and visualization:

Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib – for static plotting.
Seaborn – for statistical visualizations.
Plotly – for interactive visualizations and dashboards.
📈 Expected Outcomes
Visual insights into how air pollution levels change over time and across regions.
Identification of seasonal trends and anomalies (e.g., effects of lockdowns).
Comparisons between cities/countries with different levels of urbanization and policy enforcement.
Correlation analysis between pollution levels and external variables like population density or health data.
